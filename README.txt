This is a basic version of the "Mensch, Ã¤rgere Dich nicht" game.

1. A new game can be initiated by any of the players. After that the server distributes
the existing number of colours N among the first N connected clients.

This should be changed later. The next version: all connected clients receive an
"invitation" for a new game as soon as one of them starts it. As soon as the players
click "join", they receive their colours on a random basis, for example.

2. In the current version there is no control of allowed turns.
A player throws a dice (up to 3 times if all their tokens are on the start position;
if it is "6", an additional turn is allowed) and has to calculate the number of points
on the board by themselves. Each new dice value of new token position is updated for
all the players.
